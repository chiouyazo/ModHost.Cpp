ModHost written in C++ used to create Minecraft Mods based on the JavaBridge Fabric mod

## Getting Started
This ModHost is actively being documented at [javabridge.chiouya.cloud](https://javabridge.chiouya.cloud).

This documentation is a fork of the fabric documentation, changed to use the modhost code examples instead. (But with  the same structure of the fabric docs)
